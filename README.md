#### diamonds.ipynb

A guided exploratory data project focusing on diamonds.csv and is based on  Exercise 9.16 beginning on page 352, "Intro to Python" by Paul Deitel & Harvey Deitel, 2020

Follow the instructions for Exercise 9.16 (starting pg. 350).
Complete the exercise in a notebook. 
    1-Load: Get the file, store it in your repo, and load it into a DataFrame. 
    2-View: Display the first 7 rows and the last 7 rows.
    3-Describe: Use the DataFrame describe() function to calculate basic         
        descriptive statistics for all numeric columns. 
    4-Series: Use the Series method describe() to calculate the descriptive 
        stats for all category/text columns.
    4-Unique: Use the Series method unique() to get unique category values. 
    5-Histograms: Use the DataFrame's hist() function to create a histogram for 
        each numerical column.
Required: Use Section headings in your Markdown to make it clear that each of 
    these sections are shown in your notebook. They should be numbered 1-5 and include the keyword shown above.
Required: Include the title of the notebook, and your name and date at the top.

1: Use everything you've learned to conduct a unique data exploration project 
    using some information related to your domain. 
2: Tell a story with data (do a web search to learn more).
3: Use this project to feature all of the key skills learned - creating a 
    professional notebook, writing a good README.md (do a web search). 
4: Include challenging Python programming aspects - find a reason to use 
    filter(), map(), and list comprehensions.
5: Have fun and make it unique.
